## General

### Line breaks

The following are all recognized as a single line break: CR, LF and CR directly followed by LF.


### Whitespace and indentation

The following are the recognized whitespace characters: space, horizontal tab and vertical tab.

Some block elements use indentation for their content. The indentation level is defined by the
number of whitespace characters. This means a single tab only counts as a single character.


## Block Markup

### Paragraph

Any line that does not start one of the other block elements starts a paragraph.

::example:
  A simple paragraph here.

  >Here a space is missing after '>', and it is
  therefore also a paragraph.


### Header

A line starting with one to six '#' characters followed by at least a single space character defines
a header. The number of '#' characters defines the header level.

::example:
  # Header level 1

  ###### Header level 6

Whitespace is allowed before a header:

::example:
  # This header starts at the left boundary

     ## Header with whitespace before

Hard-wrapping header text works as expected. Continuation lines can use the same header marker as
the first line:

::example:
  ### Header 3
  continued here
  ### and here


### Blockquote

A line starting with a '>' character followed by a single space defines a blockquote. The content of
a blockquote is block markup.

::example:
  > This is a blockquote.
  > Another line.
  > 
  > # Header in blockquote

Whitespace is allowed before a blockquote:

::example:
  This is a paragraph.

    > This is a blockquote with whitespace before.

Hard-wrapping blockquote content works as expected:

::example:
  > This paragraph in the blockquote
  continues here.
  > And here.

As a special case a '>' directly followed by a line break is also considered to be the starting
character of a blockquote:

::example:
  > This is a blockquote.
  >
  > The line above contains only the '>' character.


### List

A line starting with a the list item marker followed by a single space defines a list item. The rest
of the line as well as all following lines indented more than the list item marker are considered
the content of the list item and block markup.

::example:
  * List item one

  * List item two

   Another paragraph in the list

The first list item of a list must be on a block boundary. The following ones don't need to be:

::example:
  * First list item on block boundary
  * Second list item.

    Second paragraph in second list item.
  * Third list item.

This also means that blank lines must preceed sub-lists:

::example:
  * First item

    * Sub-list first item
    * Sub-list second item
  * Second item

The following list item markers are supported:

* The characters '*', '+' and '-' create a bullet list.
* A decimal number followed by by either '.' or ')' creates an ordered list.

Different list item markers are not allowed within the same list:

::example:
  * List item
  + Not a list item but part of the preceeding paragraph

  + List item in new list

When creating an ordered list, the first list item marker defines the start number:

::example:
  5. First item but numbered as 5
  1. Second item but numbered as 6

Whitespace is allowed before a list item and counts against the needed indentation for its content:

::example:
  This is a paragraph.

     * List item with leading whitespace.

       Paragraph within the list item.

    Paragraph outside the list item.
